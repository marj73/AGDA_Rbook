# Preface {.unnumbered}

Earth surface environmental processes exhibit distinctive characteristics, encompassing both spatial and temporal dimensions, along with various attributes and predictive variables.
Coupled with uncertainty and complexity issues, all this contribute to make this field of research highly challenging.
Furthermore, in the era of Data Science, the wealth of available data and the rapid development of analytical models have emerged as distinctive aspects in the realm of **Advanced Geospatial Data Analysis (AGDA)**.
The domain of AGDA encompasses data exploration, manipulation, and modelling, from the acquisition phase up to the visualization and interpretation of the results.
Mapping where events are located and how they relate to each other provides a better understanding of the process being studied.
Finally, as an increasing volume of geo-environmental data becomes more and more accessible, the demand for spatial data scientists is growing rapidly, both in public research institutions as well as in private companies.

The term "**Data Science**" was defined for the first time by Peter Naur in 1974 as "*the science of dealing with data, once they have been established, while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences*" [@naur_peter_concise_1974].
In essence, this definition frames Data Science as the technical and methodological handling of data, while the initial creation or gathering of data, as well as the interpretation of its meaning in the broader context, is not the primary focus of this discipline.
In 1977, the International Association for Statistical Computing was estabilished and further refined the concept of data science, emphasizing its role in the process of transforming raw data into valuable information and actionable knowledge ([IASC](https://iasc-isi.org/)).
The IASC articulated that data science involves not only the collection and processing of data but also the application of statistical methods and computational techniques to extract meaningful insights, which can then be used to support decision-making and drive innovation across various domainsâ€‹

In disciplines like environmental and earth Sciences, physical geography, humanities and social sciences, the use of Data Science procedures is emerging only recently, proving to be extremely efficient to deal with the complexity of the investigated process and the heterogeneity of the underlying data sources [@amato_spatiotemporal_2022].
This leads to a cultural shift, moving scientists away from individual working within their own research domain.
Indeed, disciplinary boundaries are more and more permeable, pushing scientists to be more open to collaborate among them and with decision makers on the investigation and understanding of real-world problems.
Modern earth and environmental scientists need to interact with other disciplines, apparently far from their domain.
This openness is increasingly important as society struggles to respond to the implication of anthropogenic pressures on different issues, such as natural hazards and climate change, or the harmful impacts of human activities on biodiversity, water and air quality, human health.

## Book overview {.unnumbered}

The primary focus of this eBook is the application of Data Science methodologies to analyze and understand Earth's surface environmental processes.
The scientific approaches in this emerging field (spanning statistics, mathematics, geomatics, and computer science) are often challenging to master.
Thus, while maintaining a rigorous emphasis on mathematical and statistical formalism, this eBook prioritizes practical applications in the domain of Geosciences.

Emphasis will be placed on the application of advanced geospatial tools to natural and anthropogenic hazards, and to land use processes.
Theoretical concepts will be supported by case studies achieved using spatial clustering techniques and supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., stochastic point process models for spatio-temporal cluster analysis; application of machine learning based approaches for geodemographic segmentation, susceptibility assessment and risk mapping).

### Computing lab {.unnumbered}

Computations are conducted using the R free software environment, which is specifically designed for data analysis and manipulation.

The computing labs will cover the following geocomputational techniques:

-   *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization*: examining geographical variations in statistical data distributions, including Geographically Weighted Summary Statistics ([Chapter 3]{#03-GWSS}).
-   *Cluster Detection and Mapping*: global clustering approaches--namely Ripley's K-function and Kernel Density Estimator (Chapter 4) -- and an example of local method, DBSCAN, for identifying and visualizing clustering features (Chapter 8).
-   *Random Forest*: as example of supervised machine learning algorithm. We present both the global (Chapter 5) and the local version, and we use Random Forest to introduce interpretability & explainability in machine learning (Chapter 6) .
-   *Self-Organizing Maps*: as example of unsupervised machine learning method for data clustering/segmentation and visualization (Chapter 7).

In addition, the first two chapters offer a brief introduction to the main functionalities in R (Chapter 1) and cover some basic operations with geospatial data in R (Chapter 2).

To complete the applied computing labs presented in each chapter, readers can download the datasets from here: [dataset](data)

## My Journey of Learning: Integrating Geospatial Data Analysis with Data Science {.unnumbered}

In the early 2000s, as I (Marj) embarked on my PhD journey, a new frontier was beginning to unfold in Geosciences.
Geographical information systems (GIS) were just starting to make waves, offering a fresh perspective on how we could investigate and understand the environment.
It was through my thesis on the effects of spreading olive vegetation water on agricultural land that I first delved into the world of GIS.
Each tool and technique I learned opened new doors, revealing the vast potential of spatial data in environmental analysis and processing.
This early exposure was more than just a technical skill; it was a revelation.
I began to see the world through the lens of spatial data, understanding how it could illuminate patterns and connections that were otherwise hidden.
This experience not only shaped my research but ignited a passion that would drive me to explore the depths of spatial analysis for years to come.

After completing my PhD, my journey led me to a PostDoc position where I had the extraordinary opportunity to work alongside Professor [Mikhail Kanevski](https://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/ian-mcharg/2022/mikhail-kanevski/).
Mikhail was a true pioneer, a visionary in the fields of environmental data mining, geostatistics, and the burgeoning field of applying machine learning to spatial environmental data.
Being part of his research group was like stepping into a realm where the boundaries of what was possible were constantly being pushed and redefined.
In this research team, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of spatial statistics, driven by the desire to uncover valuable insights from the complex data that described our environment.
The work was challenging, yet it was also exhilarating, as every new technique I learned brought me closer to understanding the intricate tapestry of environmental phenomena.
This experience was pivotal, setting the course for my future research and solidifying my belief in the power of combining advanced techniques with a deep understanding of spatial data.

As the years passed, the tools and resources available to researchers like me grew exponentially.
The development and widespread adoption of free programming languages like and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) revolutionized the way we approached statistical analysis and machine learning.
What was once the domain of a select few became accessible to many, thanks to the wealth of pre-developed scripts and resources these languages offered.
For me, and for countless others, this accessibility was a game-changer.
It meant that advanced techniques were no longer out of reach, and it fostered a culture of greater reproducibility in research.
By utilizing standardized, widely adopted open-source programming languages and cloud-based platforms for hosting and managing Git repositories, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), researchers can now more easily share their code and methodologies, enabling others to replicate and validate their findings.
This collaborative spirit has enhanced the reliability and credibility of scientific research and fostered a community where knowledge is shared and expanded more efficiently.

Reflecting on this journey, I realize that each step---from my early days with GIS to my time in Professor Kanevski's group, to my current role as an independent lead researcher in environmental spatial data analysis in the era of data science---has been a chapter in a larger story of discovery and innovation.
It's a story of how spatial data and advanced analytics have become indispensable tools in our quest to understand and protect the environment, and it's a story that continues to unfold with each new challenge and breakthrough.
