# AGDA_Rbook

The primary focus of this eBook is the application of Advanced Geospatial Data Analysis approaches to analyze and understand Earth's surface environmental processes.
The scientific approaches in this emerging field (spanning statistics, mathematics, geomatics, and computer science) are often challenging to master.
Thus, while maintaining a rigorous emphasis on mathematical and statistical formalism, this eBook prioritizes practical applications in the domain of Geosciences.

Emphasis will be placed on the application of advanced geospatial tools to natural and anthropogenic hazards, and to land use processes.
Theoretical concepts will be supported by case studies achieved using spatial clustering techniques and supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., stochastic point process models for spatio-temporal cluster analysis; application of machine learning based approaches for geodemographic segmentation, susceptibility assessment and risk mapping).
